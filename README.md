Hi, I’m @Chamooda 
a.k.a. - My_life_a_force_to_reckon_with



I just like computers and tech in general
Although I'm a noob right now but i'm quite interested in AI and Autonomous machinery
Secondly I love anything involving robotics (Soft Robotics especially)
 
( Imagine a robot doing a dab)
 
Out of the tech world, I’ve been making animations and learning video editing and music production while simultaneously putting crappy videos on my Youtube:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcL-95x5Ub1bWMq8YPKL
  
 
Currently I’m doing CS50’s introductory course, So If you are also doing that please help me, I keep forgetting semicolons and then mess up logic as well cause why not?
