## What I Build

- Multi-camera coordinate mapping  
- State estimation & filtering (Kalman-based pipelines)  
- Real-time object detection + tracking  
- Lightweight ML systems for constrained hardware

## Selected Work

### Autonomous Underwater Vehicle — Perception Stack
- Implemented bottom-camera displacement estimation  
- Mapped front-camera detections to global coordinates  
- Designed filtering logic for noisy underwater environments  
- Integrated perception with navigation layer  

### ConvLSTM Future Frame Prediction
- Built synthetic dataset pipeline  
- Implemented lightweight temporal prediction model  
- Optimized inference for limited compute systems
